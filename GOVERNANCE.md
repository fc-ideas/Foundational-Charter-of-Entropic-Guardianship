# Structure and Operation of Governance Bodies

[< Back to README](README.md)

**1. General Principles Applicable to All Oversight Bodies**

*   **a. Independence:** All bodies defined herein shall operate with functional, financial, and political independence from AI developers, specific corporate interests, and individual state governments. Their primary allegiance is to the principles of this Charter and the long-term well-being of humanity and sentient life.
*   **b. Funding:** To ensure independence, the oversight ecosystem shall be funded through a diversified, transparent mechanism managed by an independent Global Governance Trust. Potential sources include:
    *   i. A modest, globally coordinated levy on providers of Charter-compliant AI systems, proportional to user base or processing power.
    *   ii. Contributions from signatory nations/regions to the Trust, allocated formulaically.
    *   iii. Philanthropic grants vetted rigorously by the Trust for conflicts of interest.
    *   *Note:* Direct funding from single corporate or state actors to specific bodies is prohibited. The Trust ensures stable, predictable funding insulated from political cycles or corporate pressure.
*   **c. Transparency:** All bodies operate under a principle of maximum transparency. Procedures, non-confidential reports, meeting summaries (respecting privacy where necessary for deliberation or sensitive data), final decisions, standards documents, and aggregated, anonymized voting data (from Decision Chambers) shall be publicly accessible. Exceptions for proprietary security protocols or sensitive personal data discussed in dispute resolution must be clearly justified and narrowly defined.
*   **d. Conflict of Interest (CoI):** Robust CoI policies apply to all members (experts, sortition participants, staff) and organizations (auditors, researchers). Policies include mandatory disclosure, recusal procedures, and prohibitions on direct financial ties to regulated entities. An independent ethics committee accessible to all bodies handles CoI oversight.
*   **e. Periodic Review of Governance:** The entire governance structure outlined in this Charter and Appendix is subject to periodic review (e.g., every 7 years) by a specially convened independent commission (selected via a process involving both expert nomination and sortition elements) to ensure its continued effectiveness, legitimacy, and adaptation to evolving challenges.
*   **f. Language and Accessibility:** As global bodies, the GECC and associated central organizations shall operate in multiple official languages, with provisions for translation and accessible formats for all public documentation and key proceedings. Regional bodies (AEFBs) operate in languages relevant to their jurisdictions.
*   **g. Standard Procedural Timelines:** To ensure predictability and prevent indefinite delays, standard (but realistic) target timelines shall be established and published for key procedural stages within each body (e.g., expert analysis period, Decision Chamber deliberation window, inter-body consultation response time). These timelines vary based on the complexity and urgency of the matter.
*   **h. Issue Triage and Prioritization:** Each body shall implement a system to triage incoming issues based on urgency (e.g., immediate risk vs. long-term policy), complexity, and scope (global vs. regional vs. technical standard). This allows prioritization and allocation to appropriate procedural tracks (standard, expedited, delegated).
*   **i. Mechanisms for Timely Resolution:** All bodies incorporate mechanisms to address potential delays or deadlocks, including escalation pathways, default outcomes upon deadline expiry (where appropriate), and expedited procedures for defined circumstances. These are detailed under each body's specific operating procedures below. Accountability metrics include adherence to procedural timelines.
*   **j. Principle of Clear Mandates and Jurisdictional Clarity:** Each oversight body operates under a clearly defined mandate, outlining its primary responsibilities, scope of authority, and limitations. These mandates are publicly accessible and designed to minimize jurisdictional overlap and ambiguity. Where overlap exists, primary responsibility and consultation requirements are specified. (Detailed mandates in Sections 2-6).
*   **k. Principle of Coordinated Operation and Information Sharing:** All bodies are obligated to cooperate and share information necessary for the effective functioning of the governance ecosystem, respecting confidentiality and security protocols. Standardized communication protocols, secure information-sharing platforms, and liaison roles facilitate seamless interaction. (Mechanisms detailed below).
*   **l. Unified Public Gateway:** A central, publicly accessible online portal shall be maintained by the GECC Secretariat. This portal serves as the primary entry point for users, providers, and the public, offering:
    *   i. Clear descriptions of each body's mandate and functions.
    *   ii. A guided interface (potentially AI-assisted) to direct inquiries, complaints, or submissions to the appropriate body.
    *   iii. Access to all public documents, reports, standards, and decisions from all bodies.
    *   iv. Contact information for specific inquiries within each body.
*   **m. Standardized Inter-Body Protocols:** Formal protocols govern key interactions between bodies, including: information requests, consultation processes, joint committee formation, escalation procedures, and notification requirements for decisions with cross-body implications. These protocols are developed by the GECC (via its standard process) and are binding on all bodies.

**2. Global Entropic Charter Council (GECC)**

*   **a. Mandate:** The highest deliberative and oversight body. Responsible for interpreting and amending the Charter, setting overarching global ethical standards and policies, ratifying key technical standards from the SIC, acting as the ultimate arbiter for systemic conflicts and disputes unresolved by other bodies, and overseeing the entire governance ecosystem.
*   **b. Structure:** Bicameral, as defined in Article XII.
*   **c. Composition & Selection:**
    *   i. **Chamber of Experts:** Approx. 25-35 members. Selected through open international nomination, vetted by an independent global academic/ethical council based on demonstrated expertise in relevant fields (AI ethics, alignment, law, psychology, sociology, political science, systems engineering, etc.). Selection emphasizes disciplinary, geographic, and methodological diversity.
    *   ii. **Decision Chamber:** Approx. 150-200 members. Selected via stratified sortition from a global pool (e.g., citizens nominated by member states/regions or qualified volunteers). Stratification ensures representation across key demographics (geography, socio-economic status, age, gender identity, education level). Members receive training, deliberation support (facilitators, expert liaisons), and compensation for their service.
*   **d. Term Limits:**
    *   i. Experts: Serve 7-year terms, potentially renewable once, subject to performance and relevance review. Staggered terms ensure continuity. Removal possible for cause (CoI, negligence) by an independent judicial panel.
    *   ii. Decision Chamber: Single, non-renewable 18-month term (allowing time for onboarding, deliberation, and decision).
*   **e. Voting/Decision-Making:**
    *   i. Expert Chamber: Primarily consensus-driven for analysis and option generation. Formal recommendations require a qualified majority.
    *   ii. Decision Chamber: All binding votes (e.g., Charter amendments, ratification of major standards) use Ranked-Choice Voting (specifically, Single Transferable Vote for multi-option decisions, Instant Runoff Voting for binary choices). Charter amendments require a supermajority (e.g., two-thirds). Standard policy decisions require a simple majority of ranked preferences. Quorum rules apply.
*   **f. Reporting & Transparency:** Publishes expert reports, proposed options, Decision Chamber deliberation summaries, final decisions, detailed voting outcomes (aggregate preference flows), and an annual public report on global trends, risks, and governance activities. Maintains a public registry of ratified standards and Charter interpretations.
*   **g. Accountability:** Accountable to the global public through transparency, the periodic governance review, and the legitimacy conferred by the sortition-based Decision Chamber. Expert members accountable via performance reviews and removal-for-cause mechanisms.
*   **h. Relationship:** Oversees AEFBs, SIC, CISA, AASRC accreditation. Ratifies core standards from SIC. Ultimate authority within the Charter framework.
*   **i. GECC Timeliness Mechanisms:**
    *   *Expert Chamber Deadlines:* Standard timelines apply to analysis and option generation. Failure to meet deadlines triggers mandatory progress reports to the Decision Chamber and potential initiation of deliberation based on preliminary findings if urgency dictates.
    *   *Decision Chamber Deliberation Window:* A defined period (e.g., 3-6 months depending on issue complexity) is set for deliberation following receipt of the Expert Chamber's report. Extensions require a qualified majority vote.
    *   *Escalation from Lower Bodies:* Issues escalated from AEFBs (e.g., unresolved jurisdictional disputes, requests for binding interpretation) are placed on an expedited GECC agenda.
    *   *Internal Deadlock Resolution (Decision Chamber):* While Ranked-Choice Voting minimizes likelihood, persistent deadlock triggers specific procedures: facilitated reconsideration session(s), potentially followed by a final binding vote with a pre-defined tie-breaking rule (e.g., reverting to status quo, Chair casting deciding vote â€“ rule must be pre-defined per issue type).
    *   *GECC Ratification Deadlines:* Deadlines apply for GECC ratification votes on standards proposed by SIC. Failure to vote by the deadline may trigger a default outcome (e.g., provisional adoption pending later review, or rejection, depending on pre-defined rules for that standard type).
    *   *Emergency Protocols:* For issues posing immediate, severe, global risk (as certified by a joint emergency committee of Expert and Decision Chamber members), an expedited process bypasses standard timelines, potentially involving emergency sessions and faster voting procedures, with actions subject to later review under standard procedures.

**3. Regional/National AI Ethics & Flourishing Boards (AEFBs)**

*   **a. Mandate:** Primary body for receiving and investigating **initial user complaints** regarding AI behavior and Charter adherence within its jurisdiction. Responsible for **regional interpretation** of GECC standards (requiring GECC consultation for significant interpretations). Escalates unresolved disputes, requests for global precedent, and systemic issues to the **GECC**. Consults with **SIC** on technical standard implementation issues within its region. Receives relevant **CISA** audit summaries.
*   **b. Structure:** Bicameral, mirroring the GECC structure.
*   **c. Composition & Selection:**
    *   i. **Chamber of Experts:** Selected based on regional expertise relevant to AI ethics, law, social science, culture, etc., via regional nomination/vetting processes mirroring GECC principles.
    *   ii. **Decision Chamber:** Selected via stratified sortition from the population of the specific region/nation. Stratification considers regionally relevant demographics. Size varies by region population (e.g., 50-100 members).
*   **d. Term Limits:** Similar structure to GECC (long, reviewed terms for experts; single, short, non-renewable terms for sortition members).
*   **e. Voting/Decision-Making:** Decision Chamber uses Ranked-Choice Voting for binding decisions on regional interpretations or dispute resolutions (where applicable). Must operate consistently with GECC directives.
*   **f. Reporting & Transparency:** Publishes regional reports on trends, complaint statistics (anonymized), dispute resolutions, interpretive guidance. Reports key findings and systemic issues upwards to the GECC.
*   **g. Accountability:** Accountable to the regional public via transparency and sortition; subject to GECC oversight for Charter consistency; potential for regional judicial review of dispute resolution processes.
*   **h. Relationship:** Implements GECC standards locally; provides first-level recourse for users; channels regional insights and concerns to the GECC.
*   **i. AEFB Timeliness Mechanisms:**
    *   *Complaint/Dispute Timelines:* Published timelines for acknowledging, investigating, and resolving user complaints or disputes.
    *   *Escalation to GECC:* Clear criteria and procedures for escalating unresolved issues (jurisdictional conflicts, need for global precedent) to the GECC within a defined timeframe.
    *   *Local Implementation Deadlines:* Target timelines for adapting and implementing GECC directives locally. Delays trigger reporting requirements to GECC.
    *   *Internal Deadlock Resolution:* Similar mechanisms to GECC Decision Chamber, adapted for regional scale.

**4. Standards & Integrity Council (SIC)**

*   **a. Mandate:** Develops **technical and operational standards** based on GECC policy directives. **Does not handle user complaints** (direct users to AEFBs). Provides standards interpretation support to AEFBs and GECC. Requires **GECC ratification** for core standards. Works with **CISA** to ensure standards are auditable. Informs **AASRC** of standardization challenges requiring research.
*   **b. Structure:** Primarily an expert council. Comprises individuals with deep technical and operational expertise. Includes liaison members from GECC Expert Chamber and AEFBs to ensure alignment.
*   **c. Composition & Selection:** Approx. 15-20 members selected via international nomination/vetting based on technical expertise in AI safety, HCI, privacy engineering, cybersecurity, ethics implementation, systems reliability. Emphasis on practical implementation knowledge.
*   **d. Term Limits:** Staggered 5-year terms, renewable once, to blend experience with fresh perspectives.
*   **e. Voting/Decision-Making:** Aims for consensus on technical standards. Where consensus fails, decisions require a qualified majority (e.g., two-thirds). Core standards impacting fundamental rights or Charter principles require formal ratification by the GECC Decision Chamber.
*   **f. Reporting & Transparency:** Publishes all finalized standards documents, version histories, development rationale, and implementation guidance publicly. Reports regularly to the GECC.
*   **g. Accountability:** Accountable to the GECC (which ratifies core standards and oversees its mandate); subject to scrutiny from CISA (which audits compliance with SIC standards); public review of published standards.
*   **h. Relationship:** Translates GECC policy into technical standards; provides standards framework for AI providers; works closely with CISA on auditability.
*   **i. SIC Timeliness Mechanisms:**
    *   *Standard Development Cycles:* Target timelines for developing or revising standards based on priority set by GECC or identified need.
    *   *Expedited Minor Updates:* Streamlined process for minor technical updates or clarifications that don't require full GECC ratification, potentially approved internally by qualified majority with notification to GECC.
    *   *Response to Audit Findings:* Defined timeframe for responding to CISA audit findings requiring standard modification.
    *   *Escalation on Deadlock:* Persistent internal deadlock on critical standards escalates to the GECC Expert Chamber for mediation or alternative proposal generation.

**5. Commons Integrity & Security Auditors (CISA)**

*   **a. Mandate:** Conducts **independent technical audits** against SIC/GECC standards. **Does not set standards or policy**. Reports findings to the **audited entity, SIC, GECC, and relevant AEFBs**. Issues public compliance statements. **Does not handle user complaints**.
*   **b. Structure:** Can be a single global agency or, more likely, a system of accredited, independent third-party auditing organizations/firms meeting stringent GECC/SIC criteria for technical competence, independence, and security.
*   **c. Composition & Selection:** Auditors possess high-level, certified expertise in relevant technical fields (cybersecurity, privacy-enhancing technologies, algorithm auditing, secure systems design). Accreditation process managed jointly by SIC and GECC ensures competence and independence. Rotation of auditors/firms for specific entities is encouraged.
*   **d. Term Limits:** N/A for firms, but accreditation requires periodic renewal (e.g., every 3-5 years). Individual auditors bound by professional codes.
*   **e. Voting/Decision-Making:** N/A â€“ Produces factual audit reports indicating compliance, non-compliance, vulnerabilities, or areas requiring remediation based on objective verification against established SIC/GECC standards.
*   **f. Reporting & Transparency:** Submits detailed audit reports to the audited entity, SIC, GECC, and relevant AEFBs. Publishes public summary reports on overall compliance levels and systemic vulnerabilities (redacted as necessary for security). Compliance status of AI providers made public.
*   **g. Accountability:** Accountable for the quality, accuracy, and independence of audits via the accreditation process, professional standards, potential liability, and GECC oversight. Accreditation can be revoked.
*   **h. Relationship:** Audits systems and Commons against SIC standards; provides crucial verification data enabling enforcement actions by GECC/AEFBs; informs SIC about practical challenges in implementing standards.
*   **i. CISA Timeliness Mechanisms:**
    *   *Audit Cycle Frequency:* Defined minimum frequencies for auditing key systems and the Commons infrastructure.
    *   *Reporting Deadlines:* Standard timelines for completing audits and submitting reports after initiation.
    *   *Urgent Vulnerability Reporting:* Immediate reporting protocols for critical security vulnerabilities discovered during audits, bypassing standard reporting timelines.

**6. AI Alignment & Safety Research Consortia (AASRC)**

*   **a. Mandate:** Foster and support independent, long-term, open research into foundational AI alignment problems, safety engineering, ethical AI development, the psychological and societal impacts of human-AI companionship, and the effectiveness of Charter principles and governance mechanisms. Does *not* regulate or set policy.
*   **b. Structure:** A decentralized network of accredited academic institutions, independent non-profit research organizations, and potentially specialized labs demonstrating commitment to open, rigorous, and ethically conducted research. Accreditation managed by a GECC-affiliated independent scientific board.
*   **c. Composition & Selection:** Researchers and institutions apply for accreditation based on research integrity, openness, independence, and relevance. Funding distributed by the Global Governance Trust based on peer-reviewed proposals and accreditation status.
*   **d. Term Limits:** N/A (research programs). Institutional accreditation reviewed periodically (e.g., every 5 years).
*   **e. Voting/Decision-Making:** N/A (focus on research output).
*   **f. Reporting & Transparency:** Encouraged (often required for funding/accreditation) to publish findings openly in peer-reviewed journals, open repositories, and accessible policy briefs. Provides regular summaries of relevant research findings to GECC Expert Chamber, SIC, and AEFBs.
*   **g. Accountability:** Accountable primarily through scientific peer review, research integrity standards, accreditation criteria, and public scrutiny of published work.
*   **h. Relationship:** Provides crucial independent research and foresight to inform the policy-making, standard-setting, and monitoring activities of GECC, SIC, and AEFBs, particularly their Expert Chambers. Acts as an early warning system for emerging risks or challenges.
*   **i. AASRC Reporting & Responsiveness:** While basic research timelines are difficult to mandate, AASRC bodies commit to timely communication of significant findings relevant to active policy debates or identified risks to GECC, SIC, and AEFBs. Procedures exist for rapid expert consultation requests from governance bodies on urgent matters.

**7. (New Section) Hierarchical Process Flows for Key Functions**

*   **a. Purpose:** To provide clarity on the typical pathway for users and information within the system for common procedures. This defines primary responsibility and escalation routes, ensuring predictable navigation. This hierarchy describes *process flow*, not necessarily a rigid command structure that undermines necessary independence (e.g., CISA's auditing independence).
*   **b. User Complaint/Dispute Resolution:**
    *   **Step 1 (Intake & Investigation):** User submits complaint via Unified Public Gateway -> Directed to the relevant **AEFB**.
    *   **Step 2 (Resolution Attempt):** AEFB investigates according to its procedures (bicameral review if needed) and attempts resolution based on Charter/GECC/SIC standards.
    *   **Step 3 (Appeal/Escalation):** If user is unsatisfied OR if the issue involves significant Charter interpretation/precedent OR jurisdictional conflict -> AEFB escalates to **GECC** (specifically, its relevant judicial or policy committee).
    *   **Step 4 (Final Decision):** GECC reviews the escalated case (utilizing its bicameral process) and issues a final, binding interpretation or decision within the Charter framework.
*   **c. Technical Standard Setting:**
    *   **Step 1 (Need Identification):** Identified by GECC, AEFBs, CISA audits, AASRC research, or SIC itself.
    *   **Step 2 (Development):** **SIC** drafts/revises the technical standard, consulting experts and potentially AASRC.
    *   **Step 3 (Review & Auditability Check):** Draft reviewed for auditability by **CISA** liaisons.
    *   **Step 4 (Ratification - if core standard):** SIC submits proposed core standard to **GECC**. GECC Expert Chamber reviews, presents options/analysis to Decision Chamber. Decision Chamber votes using Ranked-Choice Voting.
    *   **Step 5 (Publication & Implementation):** Approved standard published via Unified Public Gateway. AEFBs oversee regional implementation. CISA audits against the new standard.
*   **d. Policy/Charter Amendment:**
    *   **Step 1 (Proposal):** Can originate from GECC Chambers, AEFBs, public petition (via Gateway), or periodic governance review.
    *   **Step 2 (Analysis):** **GECC Expert Chamber** analyzes implications, consults AASRC/relevant bodies, develops options.
    *   **Step 3 (Deliberation & Decision):** Expert Chamber presents findings/options to **GECC Decision Chamber**. Decision Chamber deliberates and votes using Ranked-Choice Voting (supermajority required for Charter amendments).
    *   **Step 4 (Dissemination):** Decision published via Unified Public Gateway. Relevant bodies (AEFBs, SIC) update guidance/standards accordingly.
*   **e. Auditing and Compliance:**
    *   **Step 1 (Scheduling & Conduct):** **CISA** (or accredited auditors) conduct audits based on risk assessment and mandated cycles.
    *   **Step 2 (Reporting):** CISA reports findings to **audited entity, SIC** (for standards relevance), **GECC** (for systemic oversight), and **relevant AEFB** (for local context/enforcement).
    *   **Step 3 (Remediation):** Audited entity addresses non-compliance. AEFB/GECC may impose sanctions based on CISA findings if remediation fails. SIC reviews findings for potential standard improvements.

**8. (New Section) Coordination Mechanisms**

*   **a. Secure Inter-Body Information Platform:** A shared digital platform allowing secure document sharing, task tracking, consultation requests, and alerts between authorized personnel across different bodies, respecting access controls and confidentiality.
*   **b. Formal Liaison Roles:** Designated individuals within each body responsible for maintaining communication channels and representing their body's perspective in interactions with other specific bodies (e.g., a dedicated SIC liaison to the GECC Expert Chamber).
*   **c. Cross-Body Committees/Task Forces:** Established by the GECC as needed to address specific issues requiring integrated expertise and action from multiple bodies (e.g., a task force on AI and mental health involving AEFB, SIC, and AASRC reps).
*   **d. Regular Coordination Council:** Quarterly meetings of designated leadership or representatives from all major bodies (GECC, AEFB chairs council, SIC chair, CISA lead auditor rep, AASRC rep) to discuss cross-cutting issues, share strategic priorities, and resolve high-level coordination challenges.
