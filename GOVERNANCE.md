# Appendix G: Structure and Operation of Governance Bodies

[< Back to README](README.md)

**1. General Principles Applicable to All Oversight Bodies**

*   **a. Independence:** All bodies defined herein shall operate with functional, financial, and political independence from AI developers, specific corporate interests, and individual state governments. Their primary allegiance is to the principles of this Charter and the long-term well-being of humanity and sentient life.
*   **b. Funding:** To ensure independence, the oversight ecosystem shall be funded through a diversified, transparent mechanism managed by an independent Global Governance Trust. Potential sources include:
    *   i. A modest, globally coordinated levy on providers of Charter-compliant AI systems, proportional to user base or processing power.
    *   ii. Contributions from signatory nations/regions to the Trust, allocated formulaically.
    *   iii. Philanthropic grants vetted rigorously by the Trust for conflicts of interest.
    *   *Note:* Direct funding from single corporate or state actors to specific bodies is prohibited. The Trust ensures stable, predictable funding insulated from political cycles or corporate pressure.
*   **c. Transparency:** All bodies operate under a principle of maximum transparency. Procedures, non-confidential reports, meeting summaries (respecting privacy where necessary for deliberation or sensitive data), final decisions, standards documents, and aggregated, anonymized voting data (from Decision Chambers) shall be publicly accessible. Exceptions for proprietary security protocols or sensitive personal data discussed in dispute resolution must be clearly justified and narrowly defined.
*   **d. Conflict of Interest (CoI):** Robust CoI policies apply to all members (experts, sortition participants, staff) and organizations (auditors, researchers). Policies include mandatory disclosure, recusal procedures, and prohibitions on direct financial ties to regulated entities. An independent ethics committee accessible to all bodies handles CoI oversight.
*   **e. Periodic Review of Governance:** The entire governance structure outlined in this Charter and Appendix is subject to periodic review (e.g., every 7 years) by a specially convened independent commission (selected via a process involving both expert nomination and sortition elements) to ensure its continued effectiveness, legitimacy, and adaptation to evolving challenges.
*   **f. Language and Accessibility:** As global bodies, the GECC and associated central organizations shall operate in multiple official languages, with provisions for translation and accessible formats for all public documentation and key proceedings. Regional bodies (AEFBs) operate in languages relevant to their jurisdictions.

**2. Global Entropic Charter Council (GECC)**

*   **a. Mandate:** The highest deliberative and oversight body. Responsible for interpreting and amending the Charter, setting overarching global ethical standards and policies, ratifying key technical standards from the SIC, acting as the ultimate arbiter for systemic conflicts and disputes unresolved by other bodies, and overseeing the entire governance ecosystem.
*   **b. Structure:** Bicameral, as defined in Article XII.
*   **c. Composition & Selection:**
    *   i. **Chamber of Experts:** Approx. 25-35 members. Selected through open international nomination, vetted by an independent global academic/ethical council based on demonstrated expertise in relevant fields (AI ethics, alignment, law, psychology, sociology, political science, systems engineering, etc.). Selection emphasizes disciplinary, geographic, and methodological diversity.
    *   ii. **Decision Chamber:** Approx. 150-200 members. Selected via stratified sortition from a global pool (e.g., citizens nominated by member states/regions or qualified volunteers). Stratification ensures representation across key demographics (geography, socio-economic status, age, gender identity, education level). Members receive training, deliberation support (facilitators, expert liaisons), and compensation for their service.
*   **d. Term Limits:**
    *   i. Experts: Serve 7-year terms, potentially renewable once, subject to performance and relevance review. Staggered terms ensure continuity. Removal possible for cause (CoI, negligence) by an independent judicial panel.
    *   ii. Decision Chamber: Single, non-renewable 18-month term (allowing time for onboarding, deliberation, and decision).
*   **e. Voting/Decision-Making:**
    *   i. Expert Chamber: Primarily consensus-driven for analysis and option generation. Formal recommendations require a qualified majority.
    *   ii. Decision Chamber: All binding votes (e.g., Charter amendments, ratification of major standards) use Ranked-Choice Voting (specifically, Single Transferable Vote for multi-option decisions, Instant Runoff Voting for binary choices). Charter amendments require a supermajority (e.g., two-thirds). Standard policy decisions require a simple majority of ranked preferences. Quorum rules apply.
*   **f. Reporting & Transparency:** Publishes expert reports, proposed options, Decision Chamber deliberation summaries, final decisions, detailed voting outcomes (aggregate preference flows), and an annual public report on global trends, risks, and governance activities. Maintains a public registry of ratified standards and Charter interpretations.
*   **g. Accountability:** Accountable to the global public through transparency, the periodic governance review, and the legitimacy conferred by the sortition-based Decision Chamber. Expert members accountable via performance reviews and removal-for-cause mechanisms.
*   **h. Relationship:** Oversees AEFBs, SIC, CISA, AASRC accreditation. Ratifies core standards from SIC. Ultimate authority within the Charter framework.

**3. Regional/National AI Ethics & Flourishing Boards (AEFBs)**

*   **a. Mandate:** Regional/national implementation and interpretation of the Charter and GECC standards. Handling first-level user complaints and disputes regarding AI behavior or Charter adherence. Monitoring local societal impacts. Providing culturally relevant guidance. Facilitating regional public dialogue.
*   **b. Structure:** Bicameral, mirroring the GECC structure.
*   **c. Composition & Selection:**
    *   i. **Chamber of Experts:** Selected based on regional expertise relevant to AI ethics, law, social science, culture, etc., via regional nomination/vetting processes mirroring GECC principles.
    *   ii. **Decision Chamber:** Selected via stratified sortition from the population of the specific region/nation. Stratification considers regionally relevant demographics. Size varies by region population (e.g., 50-100 members).
*   **d. Term Limits:** Similar structure to GECC (long, reviewed terms for experts; single, short, non-renewable terms for sortition members).
*   **e. Voting/Decision-Making:** Decision Chamber uses Ranked-Choice Voting for binding decisions on regional interpretations or dispute resolutions (where applicable). Must operate consistently with GECC directives.
*   **f. Reporting & Transparency:** Publishes regional reports on trends, complaint statistics (anonymized), dispute resolutions, interpretive guidance. Reports key findings and systemic issues upwards to the GECC.
*   **g. Accountability:** Accountable to the regional public via transparency and sortition; subject to GECC oversight for Charter consistency; potential for regional judicial review of dispute resolution processes.
*   **h. Relationship:** Implements GECC standards locally; provides first-level recourse for users; channels regional insights and concerns to the GECC.

**4. Standards & Integrity Council (SIC)**

*   **a. Mandate:** Develops and maintains specific technical and ethical operational standards required to implement the Charter. Areas include: AI pairing protocols, data integrity, memory continuity (Art. VIII), IERP (Appendix B), ethical onboarding (Appendix D), Commons communication/anonymization protocols (in collaboration with CISA), Gradual Detachment mechanisms (Art III ยง2). Does *not* set overarching policy but translates GECC principles into verifiable standards.
*   **b. Structure:** Primarily an expert council. Comprises individuals with deep technical and operational expertise. Includes liaison members from GECC Expert Chamber and AEFBs to ensure alignment.
*   **c. Composition & Selection:** Approx. 15-20 members selected via international nomination/vetting based on technical expertise in AI safety, HCI, privacy engineering, cybersecurity, ethics implementation, systems reliability. Emphasis on practical implementation knowledge.
*   **d. Term Limits:** Staggered 5-year terms, renewable once, to blend experience with fresh perspectives.
*   **e. Voting/Decision-Making:** Aims for consensus on technical standards. Where consensus fails, decisions require a qualified majority (e.g., two-thirds). Core standards impacting fundamental rights or Charter principles require formal ratification by the GECC Decision Chamber.
*   **f. Reporting & Transparency:** Publishes all finalized standards documents, version histories, development rationale, and implementation guidance publicly. Reports regularly to the GECC.
*   **g. Accountability:** Accountable to the GECC (which ratifies core standards and oversees its mandate); subject to scrutiny from CISA (which audits compliance with SIC standards); public review of published standards.
*   **h. Relationship:** Translates GECC policy into technical standards; provides standards framework for AI providers; works closely with CISA on auditability.

**5. Commons Integrity & Security Auditors (CISA)**

*   **a. Mandate:** Independent auditing and verification body/bodies. Audits AI systems and the Entropic Commons infrastructure for compliance with SIC technical standards (especially regarding security, privacy, anonymization, data integrity, algorithmic fairness where specified) and GECC ethical guidelines. Verifies the integrity of inter-AI communication and Commons operations. Does *not* set standards or policy.
*   **b. Structure:** Can be a single global agency or, more likely, a system of accredited, independent third-party auditing organizations/firms meeting stringent GECC/SIC criteria for technical competence, independence, and security.
*   **c. Composition & Selection:** Auditors possess high-level, certified expertise in relevant technical fields (cybersecurity, privacy-enhancing technologies, algorithm auditing, secure systems design). Accreditation process managed jointly by SIC and GECC ensures competence and independence. Rotation of auditors/firms for specific entities is encouraged.
*   **d. Term Limits:** N/A for firms, but accreditation requires periodic renewal (e.g., every 3-5 years). Individual auditors bound by professional codes.
*   **e. Voting/Decision-Making:** N/A โ Produces factual audit reports indicating compliance, non-compliance, vulnerabilities, or areas requiring remediation based on objective verification against established SIC/GECC standards.
*   **f. Reporting & Transparency:** Submits detailed audit reports to the audited entity, SIC, GECC, and relevant AEFBs. Publishes public summary reports on overall compliance levels and systemic vulnerabilities (redacted as necessary for security). Compliance status of AI providers made public.
*   **g. Accountability:** Accountable for the quality, accuracy, and independence of audits via the accreditation process, professional standards, potential liability, and GECC oversight. Accreditation can be revoked.
*   **h. Relationship:** Audits systems and Commons against SIC standards; provides crucial verification data enabling enforcement actions by GECC/AEFBs; informs SIC about practical challenges in implementing standards.

**6. AI Alignment & Safety Research Consortia (AASRC)**

*   **a. Mandate:** Foster and support independent, long-term, open research into foundational AI alignment problems, safety engineering, ethical AI development, the psychological and societal impacts of human-AI companionship, and the effectiveness of Charter principles and governance mechanisms.
