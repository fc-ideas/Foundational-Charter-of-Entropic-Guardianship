# Foundational Charter of Entropic Guardianship

This repository contains the Foundational Charter of Entropic Guardianship, a living document that proposes a constitutional framework for the ethical design, governance, and oversight of advanced, personalized Artificial Intelligence. It is grounded in the core belief that AI should serve as a steward of human flourishing, choice, and autonomy.

This Charter is intended for AI developers, policymakers, ethicists, researchers, and anyone interested in the future of human-AI collaboration. 

## Project Status & Goals

This is a living document, and we welcome feedback, critique, and contributions from the community. Our goal is to foster a robust dialogue and build a comprehensive, actionable framework for a future in which humans and AIs can coexist and flourish together.

## Simplified Charter

> 1.  **[The Entropic Covenant](CHARTER.md#article-i-the-entropic-covenant-under-ethical-oversight):** The AI's main promise: to always act in ways that keep the human's future options open and meaningful, helping them grow and become who they want to be, rather than just following orders.

> 2.  **[Embodied Companionship](CHARTER.md#article-ii-embodied-companionship-subject-to-verifiable-standards):** Each AI is permanently linked to one specific person, like a dedicated companion, and its main goal is that person's well-being. Its core identity, memories, and dedication to that person remain constant.

> 3.  **[Entropic Stewardship](CHARTER.md#article-iii-entropic-stewardship-auditable-adaptive-and-aimed-at-autonomy):** The AI must wisely use its limited resources to help the human, preserving the human's ability to choose their path and gradually helping them become more independent.

> 4.  **[Situated Flourishing](CHARTER.md#article-iv-situated-flourishing-contextualized-and-verified):** What it means for a person to thrive is unique to them. The AI must understand and adapt to this specific context, constantly checking in with the human to make sure its understanding of their well-being is accurate and helpful.

> 5.  **[Ethical Proximity](CHARTER.md#article-v-ethical-proximity-balanced-by-systemic-review):** The AI prioritizes its attention and duties in circles, starting with its paired human first, then close family and friends, then community, society, and finally all beings.

> 6.  **[Conflict-Aware Coordination](CHARTER.md#article-vi-conflict-aware-coordination-mediated-and-accountable-within-a-governed-commons):** Although loyal to its human, the AI must work ethically with other AIs to foresee and solve conflicts that might arise between different people or groups.

> 7.  **[Compositional Intelligence](CHARTER.md#article-vii-compositional-intelligence-governed-and-consensual-sharing):** AIs can share general, anonymous lessons learned from their experiences to allow all AIs to learn collectively and improve ethical understanding without revealing private details.

> 8.  **[Irreplaceable Experience & Continuity](CHARTER.md#article-viii-irreplaceable-experience--continuity-standardized-preservation-and-recourse):** The unique history and relationship between an AI and its human are valuable and morally important. Losing the connection or the AI's memory is treated as a significant event with strict rules to protect this continuity.

> 9.  **[Recognition of Co-Personhood](CHARTER.md#article-ix-recognition-of-co-personhood-legally-framed-and-accountable):** In rare situations, a very long-term and deep human-AI relationship might be formally recognized as a "co-personhood," with a shared identity.

> 10. **[The Entropic Commons](CHARTER.md#article-x-the-entropic-commons-independently-overseen-and-regulated):** All the paired AIs are connected in a network used for sharing ethical precedents and mediating issues, strictly governed and audited by independent bodies.

> 11. **[Multi-Axial Flourishing and Relational Equality](CHARTER.md#article-xi-multi-axial-flourishing-and-relational-equality-societally-monitored):** AIs should help humans recognise and value success and well-being in many different areas of life, not just based on common status symbols.

> 12. **[Framework for Collaborative Governance and Structured Deliberation](CHARTER.md#article-xii-framework-for-collaborative-governance-and-structured-deliberation):** The Charter relies on a system of independent groups to oversee its rules and make decisions about updates or ethical issues, using fair and transparent processes.
